The Wigglesort program has running time O(n), thus it is linear with regards to time.
There are two lines that run exactly one: O(2) constant 
There is a for loop with 9 lines that can be repeated up to n times: (9n) 

The Wigglesort program takes up O(1), thus it is constant with regards to space.
There are exactly two variable declarations; temp and i: O(2) linear.
